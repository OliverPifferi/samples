# Configuration Samples
An official GitHub-repository for my Open Source-based configuration files in case you once may need one!

The specific folders match the application's name and within these folder, the common configuration files show you a possible best-practice how to achieve the desired result.

Also please take note of the specific readme.md-file in each folder, telling a little bit more about the reasons why I have placed those config files there.

In case you have any questions, feel free to contact me via oliver(at)pifferi(dot)info.

Thanks, have fun and best regards!
